## Explanatory notes:
1. The header in each of the XML files (supplied in 2011) claimed copyright by Myanmar Bible Society.
2. However, the source files for the translations hosted by Myanmar Bibles were all generated by a script. viz.

   "Converted into OSIS by text2osis.pl. Source text was typed in SawMu and converted to Unicode using TecKIT." 
3. Yet having been published in 1853, the S'gaw Karen Bible text must be Public Domain.
4. The conversion to Unicode and formating as XML or USFM are the modern actions.
5. Such format shifting is not a copyrightable action in most jurisdictions.
